      "Sleep affects every part of health — learn seven practical, research-backed habits to improve sleep quality tonight.",
    content: `Good sleep isn't a luxury — it's a biological necessity. Below are seven practical steps you can start using today.

1) Stick to a schedule: Wake up and go to bed at the same time every day, even on weekends. A consistent schedule trains your circadian rhythm and improves sleep quality.

2) Limit screens before bed: Blue light from phones and laptops suppresses melatonin. Stop using screens 60–90 minutes before sleep or use blue-light filters.

3) Make your room dark and cool: 18–20°C (64–68°F) and blackout curtains will help. Darkness signals your brain to produce melatonin.

4) Move daily but not too late: Regular exercise improves sleep, but vigorous workouts within an hour of bedtime can be stimulating.

5) Watch your evening meals: Heavy meals, caffeine after mid-afternoon, and alcohol close to bedtime can disrupt sleep architecture.

6) Create a wind-down routine: Reading, light stretching, or a 10-minute breathing exercise helps shift your physiology into rest mode.

7) Limit naps to 20–30 minutes: Short naps can boost alertness without harming nighttime sleep if taken earlier in the day.

If sleep problems persist for several weeks despite improving habits, seek professional advice — persistent insomnia can have medical causes.`,

    excerpt:
      "SEO is essential for organic traffic. This article explains the quick wins for making client-rendered React sites discoverable.",
    content: `React sites can rank well if you make sure search engines can index your content. Follow these steps:

- Use meaningful <title> and <meta description> tags per page (React Helmet or set document.title in each route).
- Provide unique URLs for content and server-friendly sitemaps.
- Use server-side rendering (Next.js) or prerendering where possible for faster indexing.
- Create structured content: headings (H1, H2), paragraphs, and alt tags on images.
- Make pages load fast: optimize images, lazy-load below-the-fold content, and minimize blocking JS.

Even without SSR, Google can index client-side content, but the safer path for rapid discovery is pre-rendering or SSR when possible.`,

3) Eliminate distractions: Silence notifications, close unused tabs, and clear your desk.
4) Prioritize high-impact tasks: Do the most important work first.
5) Take regular breaks: Short walks or stretches boost creativity.
6) Batch similar tasks: Group emails, calls, and admin tasks together.
7) Use tools wisely: Calendars, to-do apps, and automation can save hours.
8) Review weekly: Reflect on progress and adjust your plan.

Consistency with these habits compounds over time into huge productivity gains.`,

      "Improve your React app’s speed with these quick, effective optimizations.",
    content: `React is powerful, but performance can suffer without care. Here's how to keep your app fast:

- Use React.memo for components that don’t need to re-render often.
- Avoid anonymous functions inside JSX; declare them outside when possible.
- Lazy-load routes and heavy components with React.lazy and Suspense.
- Keep state local where possible — avoid overusing global state.
- Minimize unnecessary API calls with caching or debouncing.
- Use virtualization for long lists (react-window, react-virtualized).
- Profile your app using React DevTools to spot bottlenecks.

Small tweaks in the right places can drastically reduce load times and improve UX.`,
